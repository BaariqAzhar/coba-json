<p><strong>WHY ARE SOFT SKILLS IN THE WORKPLACE IMPORTANT?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing soft skills at work is critical for so many reasons. On the whole, research has found that employees with soft skills training are 12% more productive than those without them. This translates into a whopping 256% ROI for companies!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that doesn&rsquo;t convince you, then maybe the findings from Deloitte&rsquo;s Global Human Capital Trends report will. Over 90% of respondents rated soft skills as critical for fostering employee retention, improving leadership, and building a meaningful culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But developing soft skills in the workplace also helps companies to avoid costs, not just make money. Why? Because when soft skills are lacking, employees become prone to conflict, suffer from low self-confidence, feel unheard and misunderstood, and ultimately, become unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know what the consequences of unhappy employees are? Increased absenteeism, poor performance, bad customer service, low quality work, and eventually (drumroll, please), decreased profit.</span></p>
